Game made for MAD players at MADBOX

- To made this game I spent almost 4 hours.

- The most difficult part was the player movement using the joystick.

- I belive that I've could improve the player movement, and the variety of obstacles.

- I thought about implementing a feature like Superhot game, the obstacles will only move, when the player moves, I think that would be fun.
